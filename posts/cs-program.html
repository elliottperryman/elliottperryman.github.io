    <h1>Computer Science at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK) </h1>
    <p>
      When I first went to UTK, I signed up for computer science for mostly practical reasons. I thought it should have okay job prospects. I wanted to do something challenging and not oriented towards managing people. I thought it should have math involved; also, I am particularly bad at spatial tasks like disassembling and assembling parts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow, I signed up, and it was perfectly fine. I started in C++ and moved to C. I like C the most, as it is so close to how the machine works. One class I had we even programmed in assembly and then intel binary commands. In another, we drew circuit diagrams for different processes. I found this part, which many of my classmates detested, to be quite useful. My reason is that when I think about a program in terms of its effect on the hardware, the procedure is much simpler. I think this deconstruction is a great addition to the usual methods of teaching program optimization because it gives I think more intuition and teaches how to deconstruct problems. 
    </p>

      Later, I joined the physics department as well, which I won't talk about here. Within the computer science program, I am really glad to learn the basics: C, C++, hardware, algorithms, and data structures. I also was able to take some machine learning and numerical methods classes from the CS/Math department that were of huge help later on in work at Oak Ridge.
