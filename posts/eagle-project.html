    <h1>Reflecting on My Eagle Scout Project</h1>

    <img src="eagle_scout_project_image.jpg" alt="Eagle Scout Project - Accessibility Ramp at Chickasaw Trace State Park">

    <p>
        I want to take a moment to share my experience with my Eagle Scout project at Chickasaw Trace State Park in Columbia, TN. We (me and those that generously gave time to help me) also took the opportunity to fix some shingling on the pavilion roof.
    </p>

    <p>
        The journey of constructing a concrete accessibility ramp was both challenging and fulfilling. Every step, from planning to finishing touches, taught me valuable lessons in dedication and teamwork. I'm grateful for the chance to contribute to the park and make it more inclusive for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to the ramp, we addressed some issues with the pavilion's roof shingling. It was a small part of the overall project, but we wanted to ensure the pavilion's functionality and appearance were improved.
    </p>

    <p>
        I owe a huge thank you to Mr. Upchurch and everyone involved. Without their support, this project wouldn't have been possible. It's a humbling experience, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to leave a positive impact on Chickasaw Trace State Park.
    </p>

    <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

    <p>
        Special thanks to Mr. Upchurch for his mentorship and expertise. I'm also grateful for the support from my family, and Scout Troop 103, especially my troop leader, Mr. Mayberry. This project was a collaborative effort, and I appreciate everyone who played a part in its success.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you to the community and everyone who made this Eagle Scout project a reality.
    </p>
