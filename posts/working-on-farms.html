    <h1>Reflections on Farm Work</h1>

    <p>
        Attempted farming was a big part of my life, especially during the summer after 8th grade when I dove into work on Bobby and Ruth McIver's farm. Back then, my brother Abe, his friend Ben Kelley, and I decided to plant peaches and cream sweet corn with dreams of selling it later.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was a memorable experience, filled with challenges. We invested $125 in seed corn, spent endless hours planting. In contrast, Bobby threw in some sunflower seeds late one afternoon. Little did we know, a drought that summer would teach us the unforgiving nature of farming. Despite losing all our corn, the sunflowers surprisingly flourished, bringing in $75. This early lesson emphasized the unpredictability and difficulty inherent in agriculture.

        Despite the setbacks, I continued working on the McIver's farm over the following summers, although now with an hourly salary and no hopes of producing anything. I transitioned to cleaning, fixing, and and baling hay - these became some of my favorite moments. There's something about the physical exertion and the grass smells that made it satisfying. I also helped baling hay for the Shoup farm.

        Later, I found myself on Scott Williams' farm, where I mostly was pulling weeds and weed eating. This job had its own perks - $10 per hour and the freedom to work as much overtime as I wanted. It meant long weeks, often surpassing 50 hours, including holidays. I would say: "It wasn't just about the money; I genuinely enjoyed the work and the connection to the land." But that's all nostalgia. I liked earning some money: I used the money from this to travel to Europe with my friend Sina Jahandari later in college. 
    </p>

    <p>
        While I don't work on a farm anymore, these experiences left a lasting impact. They taught me the value of hard work, the unpredictable nature of farming, and the crucial role of technology in the field. Looking back, I appreciate the lessons learned about earning money - it's not as easy as it seems, although spending it is.
