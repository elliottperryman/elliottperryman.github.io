I am a PhD student at the [Institut Laue-Langevin](https://www.ill.eu), Paul Scherrer Institut, and UGA where I work on methods for design-of-experiments that exploit physics knowledge and modern statistical methods. I want to solve quantitative problems using physics, applied math, and statistics. In my PhD I have spent two years working on Gaussian process models for inelastic neutron scattering. This is a closed loop design of experiments method, which we published recently.

In my undergraduate degree at UTK I worked for Nadia Fomin in the Nab collaboration at Oak Ridge on signal processing. I also took off a year and a half to work at Lawrence Berkeley Labs with Peter Zwart on crystallography, Marcus Noack on distributed optimization for Gaussian processes, and Tess Smidt on geometry.
