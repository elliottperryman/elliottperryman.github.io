I am a PhD student at the [Institut Laue-Langevin](https://www.ill.eu), [Paul Scherrer Institut](https://www.psi.ch/en), and [UGA](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/) where I work on methods for design-of-experiments that exploit physics knowledge and modern statistical methods. I want to solve quantitative problems using physics, applied math, and statistics. In my PhD I have spent two years working on Gaussian process models for inelastic neutron scattering. This is a closed loop design of experiments method, which we [published recently](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0288885).

In my undergraduate degree at UTK I worked for [Nadia Fomin](https://physics.utk.edu/people/instructional-faculty/fomin-nadia/) in the [Nab collaboration](https://nab.phys.virginia.edu) at [Oak Ridge](https://www.ornl.gov) on [signal processing](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019APS..DNP.SL006P/abstract). I also took off a year and a half to work at [Lawrence Berkeley Labs](https://www.lbl.gov) with [Peter Zwart](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/peter-zwart/) on [crystallography](https://journals.iucr.org/d/issues/2020/08/00/rr5195/index.html), [Marcus Noack](https://www.marcusnoack.com) on distributed optimization for [Gaussian processes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9652812), and [Tess Smidt](https://blondegeek.github.io) on geometry.
